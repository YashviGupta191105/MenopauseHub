She yells at me like this every single morning and every single night. My dad just tells me to listen to her (on text cause hes out of town) but even when i do she's still as mad. Am i supposed to accept this? I don't have an ounce of empathy for my mother. Even when i start feeling bad for her she makes me regret it every single time. What am i supposed to do? I think this is affecting me mentally and she's coming upstairs rn im really scared I always stay late at school because I don't wanna be home and she does this to my brother too calling him useless.
